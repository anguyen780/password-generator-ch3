## Description
Using what I learned about JavaScript, I created some JavaScript code that generates a random password based off of user inputs. Generated password was affected by user inputs for defining their desired password length, if they wanted uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers or symbols. In doing this challenge I learned that it is best practice to tackle one problem at a time in order to not get lost in your own code trying to debug what you did.
